          <p>Brilliant's mission is to create a world of better problem solvers.</p>
          <p>We make games for learning in math, science, computer science.</p>
          <p>On Brilliant, you learn by doing, there are no videos, everything is interactive. We get you hands-on, figuring things out on your own. We help learners develop intuition through interaction, build understanding through experimentation, and have fun.</p>
          <p>Today, we focus on topics that will improve your ability to think and reason from first principles. We're especially focused on developing interest and excitement for STEM topics in beginners.</p>
          <p>Over time, we'll become the place where anyone can learn any STEM topic deeply inside of a game.</p>
